Hi there, my name is Gavin Bosman. I am a senior computer science student currently studying at Ontario Tech University in Oshawa, Ontario. 

For now, these files and scripts build a basic but clean portfolio to highlight some of my front end developing skills. I would like to eventually utilize PyScript among other things to directly embed some of my python projects, rather than having to recode everything in JS.

I am utilizing the bulma framework to help style my website.
